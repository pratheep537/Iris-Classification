## 📌 Project Overview

This project is a complete web-based **Iris flower classifier**, built using **Machine Learning** and **Flask**.

It was developed as **Task 1 of my internship at Afido Tech**, with the goal of understanding how to build, test, and deploy a real-world ML model.

The app predicts the **species of an Iris flower** based on user input for:

* Sepal Length
* Sepal Width
* Petal Length
* Petal Width

---

## 🎯 Key Highlights

* ✅ Model: `DecisionTreeClassifier` from `scikit-learn`
* ✅ Dataset: Iris Dataset (150 samples, 3 classes)
* ✅ Accuracy: **96.67%** on test data (20% split)
* ✅ Tech Stack: Python, Flask, HTML/CSS, Bootstrap
* ✅ Input Validation: Real-time form-based prediction
* ✅ Creative Touch: Floral background + responsive UI

## 🔍 Learning Outcomes

During this project, I explored:

* Preprocessing and splitting real-world datasets
* Training and tuning Decision Trees
* Evaluating model performance using accuracy score
* Flask routing, form handling, and integration with ML model
* Web UI/UX using Bootstrap and custom styling
* Professional documentation and GitHub publishing
